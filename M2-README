Making Mes and Mes C Library M2-Planet friendly

Requirements:

    hex2, M1, M2-Planet binaries in PATH
    i686-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc in PATH
    Nyacc-0.86.0 in GUILE_LOAD_PATH (http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/nyacc/nyacc-0.86.0.tar.gz)

easiest to setup is by running

    guix environment mes

Phases configure and check are included in the build phase:

   ./M2-build.sh

This runs ./M2-compile.sh for crt1.c, libc.c, a number of scaffold tests and mes.c,
then runs ./M2-test.sh for each of them.


Current status:

Most M2-Planet'izing work has been done in

    053c1d96 mescc: Mes C Library: libc.M2 WIP
    b824e578 core: mes.M2: WIP

mostly using pretty obnoxious #if __M2_PLANET__ for now, some
constructs may land in M2-Planet and we won't have to re-rewrite
these.  See commit messages for details.

src/mes.M2-out runs but segfaults while attempting to load boot-0.scm, try:

    MES_PREFIX=mes src/mes.M2-out

the problem is captured in scaffold/read-boot, try:

    MES_PREFIX=mes scaffold/read-boot.M2-out


TODO:

* Fix all failing tests.
* On "wip" branch, add tests for functions in lib/libc.c.
* Add tests for functions in lib/linux/libc.c?
* get src/mes.M2-out to pass all Scheme tests/*.test and MesCC scaffold/tests/*.c
